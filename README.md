## Province of Brescia and Air Pollution
This project aims to study the level of air pollution in the province of Brescia, focusing on PM10 and PM2.5 values, in order to understand which municipalities are the most polluted and whether there is a relationship between the level of air pollution and the presence of intensive livestock farms. After a brief introduction about the province of Brescia, it will take into account the monthly levels of PM10 and PM2.5 in each municipality and find the worst period of the year. Then, it will evaluate the spatial autocorrelation of the air pollution and if it is influenced by the presence of intensive farming and their ammonia emission.
